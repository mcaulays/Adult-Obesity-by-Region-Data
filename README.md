# Adult Obesity by Region Data
Unit 3 Final Project for English 105
# Overview
This repository provides data and data analysis on the prevalence of Adult obesity in four different regions of the United States. This repository contains two notable folders:
1. Data: which holds two files, one being the original [County Health Dataset](Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv), and the second being the manipulated data subset, [Adult Obesity by Region.](Data/Average_of_AO_by_Region.csv)
2. CoLab Notebook: This folder contains a python notebook that details the process of downloading data, coding to create a new subset of data, and the exportation of the manipulated data with the use of Python3. This file is under the name Data_Computation_and_Coding1.ipynb.
## Getting Started
To follow along, you can download the [County Health Data .csv](Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) file under the Data folder. To recreate the manipulated data subset, be sure to have Google CoLabs on your device. 
# What is the Purpose of this Repository?
Obesity rates are becoming increasingly concerning to many health experts in the United States especially with how common it is that Americans die of Heart Disease. This repository and the data within it was created with the goal of presenting potential factors in what causes the prevalence of Adult Obesity. The purpose of comparing the rates by region of the US was to determine if there was a defining cultural factor that increased the prevalence of obesity. This repository makes this data available to the public so that research and analysis on this subject can be further discussed and conducted. 
# Who is this Data for?
This data is for both individuals hoping to learn more and also for experts who are hoping to make a change in obesity rates and thus need to determine what parts of US culture, whether they be different by region, cause high obesity rates. 
# How Might this Data be Used?
The findings on adult obesity rates by region can be used to conduct further research on what causes obesity rates in the US. Data like this and additional research can be helpful for health experts and politicians should they desire to create a healthier America and enact policies to do so.
# Where was this Data Acquired?
The County Health Dataset was provided to our English 105 class by our instructor, Dr. Gotzler. This data came from the Davis Library Research Hub at UNC Chapel Hill.
