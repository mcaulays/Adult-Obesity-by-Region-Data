# Adult Obesity by Region Data
Unit 3 Final Project for English 105
# Overview
This repository provides data and data analysis on the prevalence of Adult obesity in four different regions of the United States. This repository contains two notable folders:
1. Data: which holds two files, one being the original County Health Data set, and the second being the manipulated data subset, Adult Obesity by Region.
2. Documentation: This folder contains a python notebook that details the process of downloading data, coding to create a new subset of data, and the exportation of the manipulated data with the use of Python3. 
# What is the Purpose of this Repository?
Obesity rates are becoming increasingly concerning to many health experts in the United States especially with how common it is that Americans die of Heart Disease. This repository and the data within it was created with the goal of presenting potential factors in what causes the prevalence of Adult Obesity. The purpose of comparing the rates by region of the US was to determine if there was a defining cultural factor that increased the prevalence of obesity. This repository makes this data available to the public so that research and analysis on this subject can be further discussed and conducted. 
# Who is this Data for?
This data is for both individuals hoping to learn more and also for experts who are hoping to make a change in obesity rates and thus need to determine what parts of US culture, whether they be different by region, cause high obesity rates. 
# How Might this Data be Used?
The findings on adult obesity rates by region can be used to conduct further research on what causes obesity rates in the US. Data like this and additional research can be helpful for health experts and politicians should they desire to create a healthier America and enact policies to do so.
# Data Visualization
Below is a bar chart that visualizes the adult obesity rates by the four regions of the US. With this graph we can see that there is not a huge difference between regions. This graph was created using the website Datawrapper. This website is available for free use to the public. 
* note to Dr. Gotzler I have this graph downloaded on my computer I'm just not sure how to upload it into markdown I was hoping to get help with this in class*
# Where was this Data Acquired?
The County Health Dataset was provided to our English 105 class by our instructor, Dr. Gotzler.
